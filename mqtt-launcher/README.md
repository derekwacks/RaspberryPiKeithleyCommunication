# mqtt-launcher

_mqtt-launcher_ is a Python program which subscribes to a set of [MQTT] topics
and executes processes on the host it's running on. Launchable processes are
configured on a per/wildcard basis, and they can be constrained to run only if
a particular text payload is contained in the message.

For example, I can publish a message to my MQTT broker requesting _mqtt-launcher_ 
create a particular semaphore file for me:

```
mosquitto_pub -t sys/file -m create
```

The configuration file must be valid Python and it is loaded once. It contains
the topic / process associations.

```python
# topic         payload value           program & arguments
"sys/file"  :   {
                    'create'        :   [ '/usr/bin/touch', '/tmp/file.one' ],
                    'false'         :   [ '/bin/rm', '-f', '/tmp/file.one'    ],
                    'info'          :   [ '/bin/ls', '-l', '/tmp/file.one' ],
                },
```

Above snippet instructs _mqtt-launcher_ to:

* subscribe to the [MQTT] topic `sys/file`
* look up the payload string and launch the associated programs:
  * if the payload is `create`, then _touch_ a file
  * if the payload is the string `false`, remove a file
  * if the payload is `info`, return information on the file

The payload value may be `None` in which case the eacho of the list elements
defining the program and arguments are checked for the magic string `@!@` which
is replaced by the payload contents. (See example published at `dev/2`, `dev/3` and `dev/4` below.)

_mqtt-launcher_ publishes _stdout_ and _stderr_ of the launched program
to the configured topic with `/report` added to it. So, in the example
above, a non-retained message will be published to `sys/file/report`.
(Note that this message contains whatever the command outputs; trailing
white space is truncated.)

Here's the obligatory "screenshot".

## Configuration

_mqtt-launcher_ loads a Python configuration from the path contained in
the environment variable `$MQTTLAUNCHERCONFIG`; if unset, the path
defaults to `launcher.conf`. See the provided `launcher.conf.example`.

## Logging

_mqtt-launcher_ logs its operation in the file configured as `logfile`.

## Requirements

* Python
* [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.3.1)

## Credits

This program was inspired by two related tools:
* Peter van Dijk's [mqtt-spawn](https://github.com/PowerDNS/mqtt-spawn)
* Dennis Schulte's [mqtt-exec](https://github.com/denschu/mqtt-exec). (I'm not terribly comfortable running NodeJS programs, so I implemented the idea in Python.)
